# Color-Text-Editor
CLI Text Editor allows users to create and save text files with colors and formatting. The Editor makes use of a doubly linked list to store all the characters of the text file.

The application mainly consists of two screens (or windows) the ‘main menu’ screen and the ‘edit’ screen. In the main menu the user is majorly given two options, one is to create 
a new file and the other is to open an existing file.
When the user chooses to create a new file then a new file is created and the user is taken to 
the edit screen where all the text that the user types would get saved in the newly created file.
When the user chooses to open an existing file, then all the characters from the text file
opened is inserted into a doubly linked list to be edited or viewed in the edit screen

A few of the options which the application provides is listed below:
• ‘insert’ or ‘i’ – allows the user to enter text or a string of characters to the file.
• ‘left’ or ‘l’ – allows the user to move the pointer left from the current position.
• ‘right’ or ‘r’ – allows the user to move the pointer right from the current position.
• ‘delete’ or ‘d’ – allows the user to delete a character after the pointer.
• ‘backspace’ or ‘b’ – allows the user to remove a character before the pointer.
• ‘style’ or ‘s’ – allows the user to style the text (change colour, make the text bold etc.)
